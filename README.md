## DRISHTIKON: A Multimodal Multilingual Benchmark for Testing Language Models' Understanding on Indian Culture

### Overview

DRISHTIKON is a **first-of-its-kind multimodal, multilingual benchmark** dedicated to evaluating Vision-Language Models‚Äô (VLMs) ability to understand Indian culture. Unlike existing global benchmarks, DRISHTIKON focuses exclusively on India‚Äôs cultural richness, spanning **15 languages, all 28 states, and 8 union territories**, with **64,288 carefully curated text-image pairs**.

The dataset captures **festivals, attire, cuisines, rituals, art forms, architecture, personalities, and heritage**, enabling **fine-grained evaluation of cultural reasoning** in multimodal models.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dataset Creation

* **Data Sources:** Wikipedia, Holidify, Ritiriwaz, Google Arts & Culture, Times of India, and others.
* **MCQs:** 2,126 base questions, extended with 2,160 reasoning-augmented MCQs.
* **Multilingual Expansion:** Translated into 14 Indian languages with Gemini Pro, human-verified.
